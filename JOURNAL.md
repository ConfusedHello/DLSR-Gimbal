Today was primarily determining the viability and establishing the general idea for the project.

As both @Jay and myself are somewhat hobbyist photographers, we've both considered the idea of building our own camera gimbal for videography, considering even second-hand on Facebook Marketplace they can be a few hundred AUD. However, we've never particularly had the opportunity (or funds) to attempt it ~~we spent all our money on cameras~~.

After some debate and sanity-checking our knowledge of a few DJI gimbals, we can now categorize the majority of consumer camera gimbals as either **single-handle handheld gimbals** or **two-handle handheld gimbals**. Images below, respectively:

Now an observant individual may have realised both these form factors have one thing in common. They both stabilise the camera with 3 axis - **pitch**, **roll**, and **yaw**. Diagram by Horia Ionescu below:

So while single-handle gimbals are easier to use for phones and your standard cameras (such as the Ronin S supporting up to 3.6kg), you'll never see one on a film set where wheeled steadi-cams, sholder rigs, and other massive gimbals are used.

So what do we actually need? (Hint: this is where we establish our *scope*) Personally, my camera setup without a cage weighs approximatly 1.2kg, well under the Ronin S' 3.6kg limit or the Ronin 4 Mini's 2kg limit - so a single-handle gimbal should do fine. We'll need it to handle somewhere around 2kg, so let's set that as our target.

To summarise:
- We will be desiging a 3-axis, single-handle handheld gimbal
- The gimbal must support up to 2kg

Tomorrow's journal will probably not be as detailed as this one, definately spent too long on it.

**Time spent: 4hr**
